# Latest Status
I am thrilled to share a personal update that I will be leaving [Turing Security Lab](https://github.com/Alibaba-AAIG) at [Alibaba Group](https://s.alibaba.com) and joining the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) as a Ph.D. student to work with Prof. [Grzegorz Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/). Thanks for all the support from everyone, especially Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/), Dr. [Yewen Pu](https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/yewen-pu), and Dr. [Hue Xue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lrf-wkQAAAAJ) as my recommenders! I am so grateful to join this group and excited to continue researching computational linguistics and its cooperation with reinforcement learning.

# About Me
I am currently a 1st-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Grzegorz Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/) at the University of Alberta. Previously, I was a senior algorithm engineer at [Alibaba Group](https://s.alibaba.com), and a machine learning engineer at [Learnable](https://learnable.ai/). I received an M.S. degree in Computer Science at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu), an M.S. degree in Applied Data Science at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu), an M.S. degree in Management and Systems at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), and a B.S. degree in E-commerce from [Donghua University](http://english.dhu.edu.cn/). Meanwhile, I hold a research group called Shining Lab. For any research opportunity or collaboration in the field of RL in NLP, please feel free to get in touch.
