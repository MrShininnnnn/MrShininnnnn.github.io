# About Me
My friends like to call me **Shining** which is the mandarin phonetic symbols of my Chinese name, rather than anything listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining). There are often five letters "n" at the end of my account name, as well as the email address, to avoid being used.  

I'm a senior algorithm engineer at [Alibaba Group](https://s.alibaba.com) where I collaborate with the team to research on cutting edge innovation of NLP in security. Before that, I was a machine learning engineer at [Learnable](https://www.learnable.ai/#/) where I'm in charge of the NLP team and responsible for several researches and productions such as language modeling, semantic parsing, and text post-processing. I'm also a graduate student learning Applied Data Science in the [School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu), as well as Computer Science in the [College of Computing](https://cc.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). I received my M.S. in Management and Systems in the [School of Professional Studies](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), and my Bachelor's degree from [Donghua University](http://english.dhu.edu.cn/).

For any research opportunity in the field of NLP and RL, please feel free to contact me.
