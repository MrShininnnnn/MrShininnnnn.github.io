# Latest Status
I am thrilled to share a personal update that I will be leaving [Turing Security Lab](https://github.com/Alibaba-AAIG) at [Alibaba Group](https://s.alibaba.com/) and joining the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) as a Ph.D. student to work with Prof. [Grzegorz Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/). Thanks for all the support from everyone, especially Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/), [Yewen Pu](https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/yewen-pu), and [Hue Xue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lrf-wkQAAAAJ) as my recommenders! I am so grateful to join this group and excited to continue researching computational linguistics and its cooperation with reinforcement learning.

# About Me
I was a senior algorithm engineer at [Alibaba Group](https://s.alibaba.com), where I collaborated with the team to research cutting-edge innovations of NLP in security. Before that, I was a machine learning engineer at [Learnable](https://www.learnable.ai/#/) and was in charge of the NLP team for several productions and researches such as language modeling, semantic parsing, and text post-processing. I received an M.S. degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from the [College of Computing](https://cc.gatech.edu) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu), an M.S. degree in Applied Data Science from the [School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu), an M.S. degree in Management and Systems from the [School of Professional Studies](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), and a B.S. degree in E-commerce from the [Glorious Sun School of Business and Management](https://glxy.dhu.edu.cn/glxyen/) at [Donghua University](http://english.dhu.edu.cn/).

Meanwhile, I hold a research group called Shining Lab where I closely cooperate with Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/). For any research opportunity in the field of RL in NLP, please feel free to contact me.
