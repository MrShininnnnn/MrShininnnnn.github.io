# About Me
My friends like to call me Shining which is the pinyin of my Chinese name, rather than anything listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining). There are five letters "n" at the end of my account name to avoid being used. This website is still in the building. Please feel free to contact me via mrshininnnnn<at>gmail<dot>com.

I'm a machine learning engineer at [Learnable](https://www.linkedin.com/company/learnable-ai/about/). I'm also a graduate student learning Applied Data Science in the [School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu), as well as Computer Science in the [College of Computing](https://cc.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). I received my M.S. in Management and Systems in the [School of Professional Studies](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), and my Bachelor's degree from [Donghua University](http://english.dhu.edu.cn/).
