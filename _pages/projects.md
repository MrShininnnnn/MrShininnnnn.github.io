# Reinforcement Learning
**Temporal Differences Learning**  
> **Introduction**  
> We reproduced the Figure 3, 4, 5 in Richard Suttonâ€™s 1988 paper *[Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences](https://github.com/MrShininnnnn/Temporal-Differences-Learning/raw/master/reference/Learning_to_Predict_by_the_Methods_of_Temporal_Differences.pdf)*. We furthered explored with some assumptions on sequence length and sample duplication.
