I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Grzegorz Kondrak at the University of Alberta, associated with Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Previously, I was a senior algorithm engineer at Alibaba Group and a machine learning engineer at Learnable. I received an M.S. degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, an M.S. degree in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, an M.S. degree in Management and Systems at New York University, and a B.Mgt. degree in E-commerce at Donghua University. Meanwhile, I hold a research group called Shining Lab. For any research opportunity or collaboration in the field of RL in NLP, please feel free to get in touch.
